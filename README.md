# Fruit-Identification-CNN-model
This repository is for my BE project work which i have done !
Objective

The objective of image classification is to identify and portray, as a unique gray level, the features
occurring in an image in terms of the object or type land cover these features actually represent on the
ground. Image classification iOS perhaps the most important part of digital image analysis.
Image classification is the task of categorizing and assigning labels to groups of pixels or vectors within
an image dependent on particular rules. The categorization law can be applied through one or multiple
spectral or textural characterizations. Image classification techniques are mainly divided into two
categories: Supervised and unsupervised image classification techniques.
A computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of
matrices with the size of the matrix reliant on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification in a
image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called "classes"
The algorithms segregate the image into a series of its most prominent features, lowering the workload
on the final classifier. These characteristics give the classifier an idea of what the image represents and
what class it might be considered into. The characteristic extraction process makes up the most important
step in categorizing an image as the rest of the steps depend on it.
Image classification, particularly supervised classification, is also reliant hugely on the data fed to the
algorithm. A well-optimized classification dataset works great in comparison to a bad dataset with data
imbalance based on class and poor quality of images and annotations.


STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT :- 
1. CLONE THIS REPOSITORY. 
2. OPEN MAIN.PY FILE AND ADD THE LINK FOR THE FRUIT IMAGE YOU WANT TO CLASSIFY.
3. RUN THE MAIN.PY FILE IN COMMAND PROMPT OR POWERSHELL .
4. BOOM , YOUR FRUIT IS DETECTED 
 
 note :- 
 This image classifier only works for 3 classes of fruits,i.e,BANANA,APPLE AND ORANGE .. if you want to classify more 
 fruits just train the model (model_building.ipynb) accordingly.main objective was to build model and learn/understand 
 machine learning basics and perform classification of fruits on small scale .
